Creating a `.deb` package from a C++ project involves several steps, including preparing the project structure, creating the necessary packaging files, and building the package. Here's a general outline of the process:

### 1. Prepare the project structure

Create a directory for your project with the following subdirectories:
```bash
packagename-1.0.0/
|-- src/
|   |-- main.cpp
|   |-- ...
|-- debian/
|   |-- ...
|-- COPYING
|-- appname.desktop
|-- README
|-- packagename.pro
```
The `src` directory contains your C++ source code, `debian` directory contains packaging files, `COPYING` is the license file, `appname.desktop` is the desktop entry file, `README` is an optional file, and `packagename.pro` is a special `.pro` file for packaging[3].

### 2. Create the `packagename.pro` file

This file is crucial for packaging. It should contain the following contents:
```makefile
SUBDIRS += src
TEMPLATE = subdirs
CONFIG += ordered warn_on qt debug_and_release
```
This file tells the packaging system where to find the source code and how to build it[3].

### 3. Create the `debian` directory structure

The `debian` directory should contain the following files and subdirectories:
```bash
debian/
|-- changelog
|-- control
|-- copyright
|-- rules
|-- source
|   |-- format
|-- ...
```
These files are used to describe the package, its dependencies, and how to build it[3].

### 4. Create the `changelog` file

This file contains a log of changes made to the package. It should be in the format:
```text
packagename (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release.

 -- Your Name <your.email@example.com>  Thu, 09 Nov 2014 12:00:00 +0530
```
### 5. Create the `control` file

This file contains metadata about the package, such as its name, version, and dependencies. It should be in the format:
```text
Package: packagename
Version: 1.0.0
Section: utils
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14), libqt5core5a (>= 5.2.1)
Description: A brief description of the package.
```
### 6. Create the `copyright` file

This file contains copyright information about the package.

### 7. Create the `rules` file

This file contains rules for building the package. It should be in the format:
```makefile
#!/usr/bin/make -f

# Uncomment this to turn on verbose mode.
#export DH_VERBOSE=1

build:
    $(MAKE) -C src

install:
    $(MAKE) -C src install
```
### 8. Build the package

Run the following command to build the package:
```
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
```
This will create a `.deb` file in the parent directory.

### 9. Sign the package (optional)

If you want to distribute the package, you should sign it with a digital signature using `pgp` or another encryption tool[1].

Note that this is a general outline, and the specific steps may vary depending on your project's requirements and the version of Debian you are targeting.
It's recommended to refer to the Debian New Maintainers Guide for the most up-to-date information on creating Debian packages.
