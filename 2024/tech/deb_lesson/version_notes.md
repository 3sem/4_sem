The version format `1.0.0` is a common format used in software versioning, known as semantic versioning[5]. It consists of three parts: `major`, `minor`, and `patch` versions.

* `major` version (1): indicates significant changes, such as new features or breaking changes.
* `minor` version (0): indicates new features or functionality that do not break compatibility.
* `patch` version (0): indicates bug fixes or minor changes that do not affect compatibility.

In the context of Debian packaging, the version format is slightly different. 
The `upstream_version` part of the version number is usually the version number of the original package from which the `.deb` file has been made. 
It may need to be reformatted to fit into the package management system's format and comparison scheme.

In Debian, the version number can have additional parts, such as:

* `debian_revision`: specifies the version of the Debian package based on the upstream version.
* `epoch`: a single unsigned integer that can be used to override the version comparison algorithm.

The comparison behavior of the package management system with respect to the `upstream_version` and `debian_revision` is described in the Debian Policy Manual.
